# QA Round #2

## Question 1

Open the file ```add-voucher-form.jpg``` in the root folder. You'll see a screenshot of our current form in Backend for adding a new voucher.

* Create test scenarios for this form to make sure adding vouchers works flawlessly.
* Considering the form changes frequently (i.e. new inputs added), how would you ensure it's always fully tested?
* Write a test and detailed example.

## Question 2

Imagine this is one of our APIs:

https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/post/statuses/update

* How would you test it?
* How would you make sure it never ever breaks in production?
* Be as much detailed as possible, write the test(s) if possible.
